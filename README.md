# dustySplineDesign

* Gen designs at https://adamspannbauer.github.io/dustySplineDesign/
  * Use `randSeed` url param for repeatability (eg https://adamspannbauer.github.io/dustySplineDesign/?randSeed=1337)
* View design from different angles with the keys <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, and <kbd>3</kbd>
  * <kbd>1</kbd> - side view of each curve plotted at once
  * <kbd>2</kbd> - animated one at a time side view of each slice
  * <kbd>3</kbd> - top down view (doesn't look great tbh...)
